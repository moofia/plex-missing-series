  <Overview>April is a smart aspiring journalist in her 20s who tries to balance her ambitious career with her family, which includes her widowed mom, rebellious little sister, and her grandmother. We meet April at a pivotal moment in her life: she's landed a fantastic opportunity to impress her hard-nosed Boston newspaper editor and an office romance with her super-sexy co-worker Dominic is just beginning to blossom. In an unexpected twist of fate, April lands in the hospital where her estranged uncle George works as an oncologist, and she learns the devastating news that she has cancer. The series follows April through her journey in the face of this daunting revelation, during a time in her life when the challenges of finding love and success would be enough to keep any girl occupied. But April is determined to fight and refuses to give up her dreams and goals.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the wedding date draws near, April is forced to face a list of &quot;lasts,&quot; such as her last week of living at home and her last time being a single girl. While her natural instincts are to have a classy and low-key bachelorette party, Vanessa (Krysta Rodriguez) helps April realize that this might be her last time to live it up. Another possible &quot;last&quot; opportunity presents itself for April when Dominic sets up a meeting for April with his book agent. With her health still in question, this opportunity may be April’s first (and last) chance to get a book published. 

Meanwhile, Leo tries to play nice with Dominic and Brenna reaches out to Finn.</Overview>
