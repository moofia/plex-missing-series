Now they meet with executives from DreamWorks to try and land a major licensing deal.

There was no deal in Season 6 for Oilerie, but is the dream still alive for the gourmet self-serve olive oil franchise?</Overview>

  <Overview>Lori Greiner and Robert Herjavec are concerned that season 6's Mensch On A Bench may be marketing too many products under the &quot;Mensch&quot; umbrella. In season 5, Mango Mango Preserves didn't land a Shark to help them acquire a production facility. They get unexpected help from their hometown of Hampton, Virginia. Toygaroo got a deal with Kevin O'Leary and Mark Cuban in season 2 for a monthly toy rental service, but things didn't go as planned. Aqua Vault got a deal in season 6 with Daymond John for their portable safe to secure valuables, but they are feeling the financial downside of entrepreneurship.</Overview>

  <Overview>History was made during Season 5 when all 5 Sharks invested $1 million in the mobile phone breathalyzer, Breathometer. Now, a dissatisfied Kevin O'Leary questions the value of their investment. In Season 6, Daymond John made a deal with Bombas, a sock business with a social mission. Can they go beyond their online business amidst strong competition? After a Season 6 appearance, the sales of Gold Rush Nugget Bucket increased three-fold. But Robert Herjavec thinks they may be missing an opportunity for further growth. Barbara Corcoran invested in the seasonal decoration kits, Hoppy Paws, during Season 6. Are they now spending too much time creating new products?</Overview>
